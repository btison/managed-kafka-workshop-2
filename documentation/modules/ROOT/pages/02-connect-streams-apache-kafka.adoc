= Connecting OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka

As a developer, you can connect your OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka cloud service to your OpenShift cluster using the Red Hat OpenShift Application Services (RHOAS) operator.

The Red Hat OpenShift Application Services operator allows you to represent Red Hat Cloud Services as first class citizens in your OpenShift environment. This enables you to work and integrate with these services using standard OpenShift/Kubernetes features and APIs. The Red Hat OpenShift Application Services operator is installed and available in your sandbox OpenShift Environment.

== Get access to the Developer Sandbox

The link:https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox[Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift] provides you with a private OpenShift environment in a shared, multi-tenant OpenShift cluster that is pre-configured with a set of developer tools.

You can spin up and access your Developer Sandbox with your Red Hat account (the same account you used to create an OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka instance).

. In a browser window, go to https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox/get-started[developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox/get-started].

. Click the *Launch your Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift* button.

. If required, log in in with your Red Hat account username and password.

. If this is the first time you use the Developer Sandbox, your account needs to be set up. This includes a phone verification step to reduce the creation of fraudulent accounts. After this step it will take a couple of seconds to set up the sandbox. +
Click the *Start using your sandbox* button to launch the sandbox.
+

. Click *DevSandbox* to log into your sandbox.

. You are redirected to the _Developer Perspective_ of your sandbox OpenShift environment. Feel free to take or skip the _Get Started_ tour.

== Connect the OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka instance to your OpenShift project

In this part of the workshop you connect your Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka instance to your OpenShift project. This can be done from the Developer perspective on the OpenShift console.

. In a browser window, navigate to the _Developer Perspective_ of your sandbox OpenShift environment.
. In the Developer perspective, select the *+Add* view. Locate the *Developer Catalog* card with the *Managed Services* entry
+
image::openshift-console-developer-catalog.png[]
. Click the *Managed Services* link. This opens the Managed Services page, which has a card for *Red Hat OpenShift Application Services*.
+
image::openshift-console-application-services.png[]
. In order to discover the managed services you are entitled to, you need to unlock the functionality with a token obtained from link:https://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com]. +
Open a new browser tab and navigate to link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token[console.redhat.com/openshift/token]. Click on *Load token* in the *Connect with offline token* box. Copy the generated API token.
. Go back to the browser tab with the OpenShift console, and click the *Red Hat OpenShift Application Services* card. Paste the API token value in the *API Token* field. Click *Connect*. +
You are redirected back to the *Managed Services* page, which shows now a card for *Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka*.
+

. Click the *Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka* card, and click *Connect*. This opens a page which shows the Kafka instances that you can connect to. Select the entry corresponding to the Kafka instance you created previously. Click *Next*
+
image::openshift-console-rhosak-connect.png[]
. You are redirected to the *Topology View* of the Developer perspective, which now shows an entry for the managed Kafka instance.
+
image::openshift-console-topology-rhosak.png[]
. The entry is backed by a `KafkaConnection` custom resource created by the OpenShift Application Services operator. To see the details of the KafkaConnection resource, click on the resource in the Topology view, and in the Details window, select *Edit KafkaConnection* to see the YAML structure of the custom resource. +
Notice that the YAML structure contains the bootstrap URL to the Kafka broker, as well as a reference to a secret containing the data of a service account, named `rh-cloud-services-service-account`.
. As part of connecting to the managed Kafka instance, a service account is created. On the *Service Accounts* page of the *Application and Data Services -> Service Accounts* page of the link:https://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com] console, check that a service account was created by the OpenShift Application Services operator. Look for a service account with a name like `rhoas-operator-xxx`.

You have successfully connected your OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka service to your OpenShift cluster. You are now ready to connect your applications to the Kafka instance using Service Binding.
